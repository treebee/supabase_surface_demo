# SupabaseSurfaceDemo

This is a demo of using [Surface](https://github.com/surface-ui/surface) with Supabase.
Mostly it's a playground for myself to get more familiar with Surface and Supabase and maybe end
up with a bunch of reusable components for rapid future development.

Currently testing out the components created in the [supabase-surface](https://github.com/treebee/supabase-surface) repo.
